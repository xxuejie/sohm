Sohm
====

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xxuejie/sohm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xxuejie/sohm)

This forks [ohm](https://github.com/soveran/ohm) so as to work with [twemproxy](https://github.com/twitter/twemproxy) or similar systems.

`Sohm` means `Slim ohm`.

If you are able to use full-featured Redis(for example, if you are using Redis cluster via Sentinel), you should definitely think about using the original ohm.

However, if you are using twemproxy-like system, and you are okay with limited features, feel free to take a look at this project :)
